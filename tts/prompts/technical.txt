NMEA 0183 devices are designated as either talkers or listeners (with some devices being both),
employing an asynchronous serial interface with the following parameters:
Baud rate: 4800
Number of data bits: 8 (bit 7 is 0)
Stop bits: 1 (or more)
Parity: none
Handshake: none
NMEA 0183 allows a single talker and several listeners on one circuit. The recommended interconnect
wiring is a shielded twisted pair, with the shield grounded only at the talker. The standard dos not specify
the use of a particular connector. Note: The new 0183-HS standard (HS = high speed) introduced in
version 3.0 uses a 3-wire interface and a baud rate of 38400. This type of interface is not discussed here.
