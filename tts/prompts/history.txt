Born in 95 B.C. in Utica, Africa (now in Tunisia) Marcus Porcius Cato, also known as Cato of Utica or Cato the Younger was a very conservative Roman senator.
He struggled to preserve the Roman Republic against power seekers, such as Julius Caesar, whom he hated more than anything.
Maybe it was his unusual personality or the fact that he was immune to bribes and fought to uphold Roman traditions that contributed to the glorifying accounts of his reign by later authors.
To many, Cato the Younger represented a model of virtue.
In time, Cato the Younger showed he was suitable for becoming a man of great political importance.
Cato's grandfather Cato the Elder (234 B.C. - 149 B.C.) had been famous for his conservative and anti-Hellenic policies.
Cato the Younger demonstrated his strong will to maintain the old Roman traditions on numerous occasions.
